This is a simple full-stack application that uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack.

I based this application on one of Brad Traversy's Udemy/YouTube courses. However, I personalized it by using the React Context API to manage global state rather than use React Redux as Brad did in the course. Additionally, rather than store my database URI key in a .js file as Brad did, I used a .env file and dotenv as is often done with API keys for security purposes.
